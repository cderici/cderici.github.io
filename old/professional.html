	    <h5>Programming Languages</h5>

	      <p> Some of you may have heard,
	      that <a href="http://blog.racket-lang.org/2018/01/racket-on-chez-status.html">Racket
	      on Chez Scheme</a> is happening. To make it possible,
	      Racket exports its various core functionalities
		(e.g. macro system, module system etc.) in the form of linklets. So any runtime that implements linklets can import those linklets and bootstrap Racket.</p>

	      <p> That's exactly what we do
	      in <a href="https://github.com/pycket/pycket">Pycket</a>. We
	      have a CEK machine interpreter for Racket, which is implemented
	      in RPython, and the RPython framework generates a
	      tracing JIT compiler that implements Racket. Moreover,
	      by importing Racket bootstrap linklets, Pycket is able
	      to read and evaluate Racket core libraries using
		Racket's own reader and expander. </p>

	      <p> The main idea we're investigating is how to
	      efficiently compile and evaluate Racket. I hope to later
	      on generalize our studies and turn this into a
	      dissertation for my PhD. </p>

	    <h4>Before IU</h4>

	    <p>The study of <b>programming languages</b> and <b>functional programming</b> is always central among my research interests. I like particularly studying continuations, operational semantics, partial evaluation, etc. </p>

	    <p> However, the lack of enough people to form an even tiny community around programming languages in Turkey is hard (we tried). Therefore, only two of my studies (about PL) went beyond being simple personal reading and simple implementations:</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li> - Proper Tail Calls From First-Class Continuations in Javascript - my undergraduate thesis (
		<a href="docs/thesis/caner_thesis.pdf"> pdf </a>|
		<a href="docs/thesis/thesis.tar.gz"> tex </a>)
		<br>
		<p> This study demonstrates that a proper tail-calling behavior on Javascript is possbile while refraining from any modification on interptereter. It is based on the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pcmkf-cont-from-gen-stack-insp/paper.pdf"> paper </a> titled <i>Continuations from Generalized Stack Inspection, Pettyjohn et al.</i>, through which a novel program transformation is presented for Javascript programs to obtain first-class continuations from exception handling mechanism. My thesis takes it one step further, showing that by using this continuation model on Javascript, achieving a tail-call optimized computation is possible, without ever touching the interpreter.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li> - E. Başar, C. Derici, Ç. Şenol, WorldWithWeb: A compiler from world applications to JavaScript (<a href="docs/worldwithweb.pdf">pdf</a>),
		<i>Scheme and Functional Programming 2009, Boston</i></li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>I also implemented numerous interpreters for small languages to experiment upon. One of my favorite is the <b>bracketed untyped lambda calculus interpreter</b>. <a href="https://github.com/cderici/fun/blob/master/lambdaCalculusInterpreter.rkt"><u>Code</u></a>

	    <h5>Natural Language Processing</h5>

	    <p>In Bogazici University (one of the top colleges in Turkey in CS) where I pursued my MSc degree, I's studying in the AI lab, doing my thesis on question answering systems in the subfield of NLP. We try to build a closed domain (geography for the first prototype) question answering system in Turkish for high-school students in Turkey. It is a government funded project where 3 faculty members (Tunga Güngör, Arzucan Özgür, Günizi Kartal) and 4 grad students (Kerem Çelik, Ekrem Kutbay, Yiğit Aydın and me) are involved.</p>

	    <p>Our QA system is named HazırCevap (an idiom in Turkish meaning quick and clever in finding answers to a question, exact translation may be PromptAnswered) and in principle based on <a href="www.research.ibm.com/deepqa/">IBM Watson</a>, thus involving several stages for finding the answer, each composed of multiple machine learning algorithms accompanied with rule based methods to basically analyse the question, retrieve and inspect relevant documents, extract candidate answers, score and sort them and finally produce the answer.</p>

	    <p>Of course, the major problems here are 1) There is no prior work on question answering in Turkish, therefore no tagged question/answer data, no prior methodologies to compare, no nothing, and 2) Turkish is an agglutinative, free-order language having very rich morphology with a derivational structure, meaning that you cannot take a Turkish sentence apart and analyse it as easily as an English sentence.</p>

	    <p>We successfully finished the first part of the system, namely Question Analysis. Here are our publications:

	      <ol>
		<li> - C. Derici, K. Çelik, E. Kutbay, Y. Aydın, A. Özgür, G. Kartal, T. Güngör - Question Analysis for a Closed Domain Question Answering System: HazırCevap, <i><a href="http://www.cicling.org/2015/">CICLING'15</a>, Springer Lecture Notes of Computer Science</i></li>
		<li> - C. Derici, K. Çelik, E. Kutbay, Y. Aydın, A. Özgür, G. Kartal, T. Güngör - Rule-Based Focus Extraction in Turkish Question Answering Systems, <a href="http://siu2014.ktu.edu.tr/">IEEE SIU 2014 (Short Paper)</a></li>
	      </ol>

	    <h5>Theory of Computation, Machine LearningL & Automated Theorem Proving</h5>

	    <p>In the first year at Bogazici, I also studied;</p>

	    <p> -- <b>machine learning</b>, where I tried to develop (with a little success) a learning interpreter for a small programming language.</p>
	    <p> -- <b>theory of computation</b> to study a bit of quantum algorithms and also the probabilistic computation.</p>
	    <p> -- <b>automated theorem proving</b>, where I developed a resolution-refutation reasoning system (a theorem prover) with <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, (see FARS in <a href="#projects"> Projects</a>)</p>

            <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li> 2015 - Present - PhD Computer Science, Indiana
	      University, Bloomington IN/USA <br><br> Studying
	      programming langauges under the supervision
	      of <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/samth/">Sam
	      Tobin-Hochstadt</a>. In particular, I'm currently
	      working
	      on <a href="https://github.com/pycket/pycket">Pycket</a>,
	      a JIT-compiler
	      implementing <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>. Initially I was trying to figure out the effects of
	      using Racket bytecode compiler as a front-end for Pycket, i.e. investigating the individual effects of
		various optimizations happening at the Racket compiler to the Pycket runtime, such as inlining or lambda lifting.
		<br><br>
		While that turned out to be rather unfruitful, it
		enabled us to do all the cool stuff that we're doing
		nowadays. (Oct 2018)

	    <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

	    <h5>Direnaj</h5>

	    <p>In Sep 2013, I participated for a project to a group of researchers (5 faculty members, and 6 grad students) gathered around SoSLab where the collection and analysis of data collected from social networks (particularly from twitter) take place.</p>

	    <p>Direnaj is a data collection, processing and visualization project, in which huge amounts of data is gathered into a noSQL DB, and processed to mine information such as centrality, betweenness or other statistics, and be visualized.</p>

	    <p>I's one of the grad students who were working on the processing part. We take the collected data, and implement library functionality that are necessary for gathering interesting information through statistical models.</p>

	    <p>You can check out Direnaj Staging from <a href="http://direnaj-staging.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">here</a>.</p>

	    <h5>Moby Scheme</h5>

	    <p> Moby was a project from the PLT Racket team, that I contributed to in the past. It is a compiler for Advanced Student Languages in PLT Racket to Javascript and HTML, targeted mainly beginners for them to be able to easily produce applications for mobile and web platforms. It turned into now a very useful and fun langauge called <a href="http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/">Whalesong</a>.</p>

	    <p> I worked with Shriram Krishnamurthi from Brown University and Danny Yoo to implement tail calls in Moby. (see Undergrad Thesis)</p>

	    <h5>Others</h5>

	    <p> My public GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/cderici">here</a>.</p>

	    <p> There you will find several repositories, each having different kinds of studies:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>FARS: is a resolution-refutation style automated reasoning system (a theorem prover), written in Racket. <a href="https://github.com/cderici/FARS#readme">(read more)</a></li>

	      <li>graphVisual: is a useful tool for producing visual representation of graphs. It is written in Racket. Also includes a tiny api useful for graph algorithm animations. <a href="https://github.com/cderici/graphVisual#readme">(read more)</a></li>

	      <li>fun: is my repository for funny and interesting (both to write and to watch) animations and programs. There you can find a lazy lambda calculus interpreter as well as an automated random maze generator.</li>
	    </ul>


	    <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>

	    <h4>@IU</h4>

	      <p>I mostly taught C211, introduction to programming, with Racket and HtDP. This semester [Fall 2018] I'm teaching it again 3rd time.</p>

	      <p>I'm also teaching P424, Advanced Functional Programming, with Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, focusing on macros, expansion and designing and implementing new languages using Racket. <a href="http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/classes/fall2018/csci/p424-samth/">Here's the course webpage.</a></p>

	    <h4>Before IU</h4>

	    <p> After I graduate from Bilgi University, I worked there as a teaching assistant for 2 years, while I'm doing my masters at Bogazici.</p>

	    <p> The assistantship at BilgiCS is not a common one, like doing a PS when needed and only responsible for reading homeworks, projects and exams, as it is the case for most of the universities. </p>

	    <p>In BilgiCS, all courses have <i>lecture</i> and <i>class</i> hours every week. Lectures are given by the professors and classes are given by assistants. Therefore we were responsible for preparing our own classes each week for every course we had (sometimes we had more than one sections and try to keep track of each section). Moreover, professors let assistants not only to read and evaluate homeworks and projects, but also to prepare them (I mean the questions of course). I've even had the chance to prepare midterm and final questions for programming languages course.</p>

	    <p> With this system, we (the assistants) were also trained to be a lecturer. I personally loved the experience. I had a lot of students and they all became my good friends :) </p>

	    <p> The courses that I've been responsible for are below:</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>COMP 179 -&nbsp; The Fundamentals of Computer Science 1[Fall 2011]</li>
	      <li>CMPE 169 -&nbsp; Algorithms and Programming 1 [Fall 2010][Spring 2011]</li>
	      <li>CMPE 170 -&nbsp; Algorithms and Programming 2 [Spring 2011]</li>
	      <li>CMN 167 &nbsp; -&nbsp; Computational and Mathematical Numeracy for Social Scientists 1 [Fall 2010]</li>
	      <li>COMP 231 -&nbsp; Data Structures and Algorithms 1 [Fall 2010][Fall 2011]</li>
	      <li>COMP 313 -&nbsp; Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs [Fall 2010][Fall 2011]</li>
	      <li>COMP 314 -&nbsp; Principles of Programming Languages [Spring 2011]</li>
	    </ul>

	      <p>Additionally on 2011 summer, I attended
	      to <a href="https://matematikkoyu.org/eng/">Nesin Math
	      Village</a> (a real village, full of mathematicians) as
	      a lecturer for two courses. I assisted the lecture on LC
	      to Math graduate students and lectured on
	      “Programming=Algebra” to high-school students. This
	      experience was almost the final seal of my decision to
	      be an academic</p>


	      <h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>


	      <p>Let's remember:</p>

	      <p><i>"If I have seen a little further it is by standing
	    on the shoulders of Giants.", Isaac Newton
	    (1676)</i></p>

	      <p><i>"We must be very careful when we give advice to
	    younger people: sometimes they follow it!", Edsger
	    W. Dijkstra (<a href="docs/EWD340.pdf">1972 ACM Turing
	    Lecture</a>)</i></p>

	      <p>Here's some talks that I did in various conferences
	      and seminars. They're not much right now, but I believe
	      in time I'll have chances for many more talks.</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>"Natural Language Processing Techniques on Tweet Data", with Prof. Suzan Üsküdarlı, from SosLab & Complex System Laboratory, <i>Inet-tr Conference, Internet Technologies in Turkey, December 2013</i></li>
