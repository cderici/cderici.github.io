	      <p>Hi! </p>
	      <p> I am a professional nerd, an avid keyboard user, amateur husband, and soon-to-be unemployed professional brain user.</p>

	      <p>Currently, I'm a post-proposal PhD candidate of
	      Computer Science at <a href="https://sice.indiana.edu/"
	      target="_blank">Indiana University</a>, specializing in
	      Programming Languages (PL), minoring in Logic at
	      the <a href="http://www.philosophy.indiana.edu/areas/ll.shtml">Department
	      of Philosophy</a>. I'm planning on finishing in late
	      2020. My advisor
	      is <a href="http://samth.github.io/">Sam
		  Tobin-Hochstadt</a>.</p>

	      <p>I recently moved to Sandy, UT. I'm currently
	      considering job opportunities, so you're more than
	      welcome to <a href="mailto:cderici@indiana.edu"
	      target="_blank">send me an email</a> is you're
	      interested in working with me.</p>

	      <p>I like all abstractions at all levels; languages,
		functions, objects, sometimes types as well. Depending
		on the language I often prefer tail recursion to a
		loop, continuations to exceptions, and I equally like
		the stack and the heap (though I'm not very fond of
		the occasional GC pressure -- who is, right?). Every
		now and then I try to use my superpowers for the good
		of others.</p>

	      <p>I often get asked what does it mean to
		study/specialize on Programming Languages. The short
		answer is, you implement programs to solve problems, I
		implement languages to do that. The slightly longer
		answer is, studying programming langauges provides a
		unique perspectives on things like <b>i)</b> how
		programmers like to express computation to either
		machines or other programmers, <b>ii)</b> how programs
		get compiled and evaluated by real or virtual
		machines, <b>iii)</b> among the many possible ways of
		writing the same software, which one has the best
		performance in terms of space and time. </p>

	      <p>I prefer collaboration and team work to competition,
	      (good) tea to (good) coffee, kindness to power. I
	      equally and unconditionally like all the bi-pedals and
	      poly-pods alike.</p>

	      <p>My undergraduate work was about adding tail-calls to
		a Racket to JS compiler. In my masters I studied
		Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing; my
		work was about developing a question answering system
		for high-school students. Currently (2019) my PhD work
		is about fast run-times for dynamic languages. In
		particular, I'm trying to show that rapid prototyping
		an efficient run-time for a self-hosting dynamically
		typed language (e.g. Racket) is achievable using an
		automatically generated tracing JIT compiler
		on <a target="_blank"
		href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">RPython
		framework</a>. You can see the details for all of them
		in my <a href="cv.html">Professional</a> page.</p>

	      <p>Finally, the most common question people ask me in
		the US is "How do you say your name?". I understand
		why it's a bit tricky for English speakers, so you may
		pronounce it however it is easiest for you, don't
		worry about it too much, I really don't mind. However,
		if you want to hear the way I say it, here's a sound
		sample:
	      </p>
	      <audio controls>
		<source src="docs/audio/name-pronunciation.opus" type='audio/ogg; codecs="opus"'>
		  Your browser does not support the audio element with opus codec.
	      </audio>

	      <p>There has been exciting developments this year (2015) that'll completely change my professional (and personal) life. While I was doing PhD and working on HazirCevap project at Bogazici (on NLP), I applied to Indiana University, Bloomington, for a PhD position in Computer Science to work on my everlasting dream of Programming Languages, and I got accepted with full financial support! (while the funding is normal for US colleges, it's a big deal around here in Europe/Turkey)</p>

	      <p>Amazing!</p>

	      <p>Now I'm getting prepared to move to Bloomington, Indiana US this summer (July 20th, 2015) to live and study there (hopefully) for a min four years. I'm now working on (for two months) finalizing HazirCevap and wrap up all the work I've done on NLP here at Bogazici and say goodbye. Things are going well. I might even have a couple of weeks to study PL to reiterate on what I've studied 2-3 years ago to prepare before the action.</p>

	      <p>Finally I'll be able to work on PL; type systems, continuations, relational interpreters, monads, Racket, Haskell.. And not only that, I'll be around with the real PL masters as well, Dan Friedman, Amr Sabry, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Ryan Newton, Jeremy Siek and all other great people (amazing grad fellas). Exciting!</p>

	      <p>It's a bit sentimental for me as well, because I did what I did within the previous (5) years only to achieve this. I love challenges, and this is by far the biggest and hardest challenge I have ever faced, because let's be real, doing CS PhD in Turkey is nothing like doing a PhD in US. I never had to put everything that I've got while studying at Bilgi or Bogazici. We all have at some point in our lives a thing that we go "I'll do whatever it takes!". I'm excited because this is that challenge for me, and I feel I have to go guns blazing for this one.</p>
