	      <p>Many many times I find myself writing something on
	      somewhere. I don't really love the written form of
	      expression (e.g. no more than speaking anyway). It's
	      like a grandpa waiting in line for his pension, awfully
	      slow and ardous compared to speaking, let alone
	      thinking. However, we are terrible thinkers, and I think
	      we need this kind of practice to linger among our
	      thoughts without losing them. Otherwise, we lose
	      ourselves at the first corner. Just like that I prepare
	      this website to organize and take a look at my own life,
	      writing lets us organize and take a look at what's
	      really going on inside.</p>

	      <p>My writing concentrates around three
	      activities. First of all, there's the academic
	      writing. It's unbelievably important sharing ideas for a
	      scientific society that transcends centuries. I
	      personally don't see it as a mere job or a
	      responsibility in that sense, however I usually prefer
	      different kinds of writing considering the writing
	      experience per se.</p>

	      <p>I do not keep a diary. However, I like to keep
	      detailed records of important events, thoughts or
	      feelings I experienced (for some disturbingly nonsensical 
	      meaning of important). I really love to keep a journal
	      of this sort because there's no audience, thus it really
	      helps to understand what's going on. Otherwise you think
	      about the reader and this empathy bomb completely ruins
	      the experience. There're however times you need some kind of an
	      audience to get away from yourself. I prefer to think of
	      future myself or my future children when such a crave
	      pops up.</p>

	      <p>Finally, my third kind of writing deals with long
	      documents/big projects (e.g. books). I don't want to
	      call these as "books", because first of all I'm not a
	      "writer", therefore I don't really know how to write
	      one, but more importantly, a book is not a one man's
	      job. There are editors, producers, designers and all
	      kinds of people working just to produce a text. My
	      writings are long and somewhat organized, but they are
	      definitely not books. Currently, there're two projects:</p>

	      <ul>
		<li><h4>Din ve Gen√ß (Religion and the Youth)</h4></li>

		<p>This is an evaluation of the logical perspective of
		  the youth on some series of topics related to
		  religion. It's not at all a religious text, rather a
		  compilation of logical fallacies in arguments or
		  perspectives regarding religion. It's in Turkish,
		  and currently around 50 pages. I might be able to
		  put here in coming days a small section with a
		  translation.</p>

		<li><h4>The Bit Story</h4></li>

		<p>The Bit Story is not a serious one like Din ve
		  Genc. It's about a special bit (a real computer bit
		  - 1/0), it's adventures around the digital world and
		  the farcical events happening in the real world
		  because of it. Our bit somehow realizes what's going
		  on and tries to fix it, leading only of course to an
		  even bigger mess of things. It's really fantastic
		  and funny to imagine this absurd story, and I
		  believe I'm reflecting this to the writing.  If you
		  know the Hitchiker's Guide to The Galaxy, you know
		  exactly the style that I'm talking about. It's being
		  written in English, and I hope to finish it the next
		  summer, we'll see.</p>
