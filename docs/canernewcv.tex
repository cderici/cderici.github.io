\section{MSc Thesis}
\cvline{title}{\emph{Question Analysis and Information Retrieval For a
    Turkish Question Answering System: HazırCevap}}
\cvline{supervisors}{\href{http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~gungort/}{Prof. Tunga
    Güngör},
  \href{http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozgur/}{Assoc. Prof. Arzucan
    Özgür}, Prof. Günizi Kartal} \cvline{description}{\small This
  study describes and evaluates the techniques we developed for the
  question analysis and information retrieval (IR) module of a
  closed-domain Turkish factoid Question Answering (QA) system that is
  intended for high-school students to support their education. We
  propose novel methods for two major problems in question analysis,
  namely focus extraction and question classification, based on
  integrating a rule-based and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based
  sequence classification approach, both of which make use of the
  dependency relations among the words in the question. We also built
  an IR module that searches for the relevant documents and passages
  through the combined use of search engines Indri and Apache Lucene.}

\section{Undergraduate Thesis}
\cvline{title}{\emph{Proper Tail Calls From First-Class Continuations in JavaScript}}
\cvline{supervisors}{\href{http://cs.bilgi.edu.tr/pages/academic_staff/lecturers/chris_stephenson/}{Chris Stephenson}, 
\href{http://cs.brown.edu/~sk}{Prof. Shriram Krishnamurthi}, Prof. Alpaslan Parlakçı, Matthew Edwards}
\cvline{description}{\small This study demonstrates that a proper tail-calling behavior on Javascript is possible while refraining from any modification on interpreter. It is based on the paper titled Continuations from Generalized Stack Inspection, Pettyjohn et al., in which a novel program transformation is presented for Javascript programs to obtain first-class continuations from exception handling mechanism. My thesis takes it one step further, showing that by using this continuation model on Javascript, achieving a tail-call optimized computation is possible, without ever touching the interpreter.
